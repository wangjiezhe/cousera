    "Supervised learning problems are categorized into **\"regression\"** (回归) and **\"classification\"** (分类) problems. In a **regression** problem, we are trying to predict results within a **continous** (连续) output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continous function. In a **classification** problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a **discrete** (离散) output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into **discrete** categories.\n",

    "Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.\n",

    "*Clustering:* (聚类) Take a collection of 1000 essays written on the US Economy, and find a way to automatically group these essays into a small number that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as word frequency, sentence length, page count, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Associative:* (关联) Suppose a doctor over years of experience forms associations in his mind between patient characteristics and illnesses that they have. If a new patient shows up then bsedon this patient's characteristics such as symptoms, family medical history, physical attributes, mental outlook, etc the doctor associates  possible illness or illnesses based on what the doctor hs seen before with simlar patients. This is not hte same as rule based reasoning as in expert systems. In ths case we would like to estimate a mapping function from patient characteristics into illnesses."
